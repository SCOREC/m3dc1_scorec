This file describes the setup process for this repository
on SCOREC machines.
Refer to the "scorec_build/tpl_build.txt" file for compiling
the dependencies including PETSc on SCOREC systems.

(0) make a directory for your M3DC1 work,
    we will call it PREFIX.

mkdir -p $PREFIX
cd $PREFIX

(1) clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/SCOREC/m3dc1_scorec m3dc1_scorec

(2) setup your environment:

source m3dc1_scorec/scorec_build/setup.sh

(3) clone the SCOREC core:

git clone https://github.com/SCOREC/core core

(4) build the SCOREC core:

cd core
mkdir build
cd build
../../m3dc1_scorec/scorec_build/core_config.sh
make install -j 4
cd ../..

(5) build this repository (the "interface")

cd m3dc1_scorec
mkdir build
cd build
../scorec_build/m3dc1_scorec_config.sh
make install -j 4
cd ../..

(6) clone the solver:

git clone https://github.com/SCOREC/m3dc1 m3dc1

(7) build the solver:

cd m3dc1
cp scorec.mk `hostname`.mk
make
cd ..

(8) get the test files

tar xzvf /lore/dibanez/m3dc1/m3dc1_tests.tgz

(9) run the test. you may need to modify
the path to the executable, I'm not positive
where the "25" comes from.

cd tests/2d/2p
mpirun -np 2 ../../../m3dc1/_jenga-25/m3dc1_2d &> log
